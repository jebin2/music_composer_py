    """Create atleast 30 second music: The sun bathed the field in golden light as Mia twirled, laughing, her dress billowing like a flower in the breeze. James watched, breathless, his heart swelling. Fireflies danced around them, tiny lanterns illuminating the dusk. “Catch me if you can!” she teased, running barefoot through the wildflowers. He chased after her, their laughter echoing in the warm summer air. When he caught her, he spun her around, her giggles melting into his embrace. Their foreheads touched, eyes gleaming with love. “Forever,” she whispered. And in that moment, nothing else mattered—just them, the stars, and endless happiness."""
